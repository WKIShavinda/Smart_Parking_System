# Smart_Parking_System

This Smart Parking System project was developed for a module named Introduction to IoT. This system basically involves Python, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Firebase technologies. The functionality of this system is, that customers will have to place a reservation via the web application prior to visiting the car park, and once they arrive to the entrance gate of the car park, the vehicle License number will be detected at the gate and be compared with the data in the database, and open the gate accordingly. When it comes to the exit gate, vehicles will be sensed by an IR sensor, and the gate will be opened.
